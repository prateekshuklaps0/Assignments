[Act as Angular Developer] 
I want to learn Angular. I am already familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Mongodb & Chakra UI.
I want to learn through chat gpt conversation. Please create a plan for me so, that i will get comfortable with Angular, I am inclined more towards learning through solving exercise.
Do not generate all content at once, give me some content which i will read and understand then provide me exercise to solve and then move to next topic and so on.
Before giving the answer, ask me any clarification question for better clarity.
