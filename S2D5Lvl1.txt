##Problem Statement:
"### Objective

The objective of this assignment is to gain practical experience in making HTTP requests to the "Fake Store API" and presenting the retrieved product data in an attractive card format in an Angular application.

### Task

Your task is to build a comprehensive Angular component that retrieves product data from the "Fake Store API" and displays it in a user-friendly card format. The data from the API represents a diverse range of products.

**API Endpoint:** https://fakestoreapi.com/products

**Data Structure (Example):**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Fancy Product",
    "description": "This is a fancy product.",
    "price": 99.99,
    "image": "<https://fakestoreapi.com/img/1.jpg>"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Awesome Product",
    "description": "This is an awesome product.",
    "price": 49.99,
    "image": "<https://fakestoreapi.com/img/2.jpg>"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "title": "Elegant Product",
    "description": "This is an elegant product.",
    "price": 79.99,
    "image": "<https://fakestoreapi.com/img/3.jpg>"
  }
  // ... more products
]

```

### Detailed Requirements

To successfully complete this assignment, ensure the following detailed requirements are met:

1. **Angular Component:**
    - Create an Angular component dedicated to displaying product data in card format.
    - Use the Angular CLI or your preferred Angular development setup to generate the component.
2. **HTTP Request:**
    - Utilize Angular's HttpClient module to make an HTTP GET request to the "Fake Store API."
3. **Card Display:**
    - Design the component's template to display the retrieved product data in card format, with each card including the following:
        - Product title.
        - Product description.
        - Product price.
        - An image representing the product.
    - Use Angular's ngFor directive to dynamically iterate through the retrieved product data and generate individual cards.
4. **Styling:**
    - Implement CSS styles to enhance the visual presentation of the product cards, making them visually appealing and user-friendly.
    - Consider hover effects, borders, and other CSS enhancements to improve the user experience.
5. **Interaction:**
    - Implement a click event handler on each card so that when a user clicks on a product card, they receive additional product details or are directed to a product details page.
6. **Loading Indicator:**
    - Implement a loading indicator while the data is being fetched from the API to improve user experience.
7. **Error Handling:**
    - Display an error message in case the API request fails. Use Angular's error handling mechanisms.
